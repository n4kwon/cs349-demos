    <h1>Cool Blog 1999</h1>
    <p>A blog about my adventures.</p>
    <h2>A trip to the beach</h2>
    <p>Yesterday, I went to the beach to see the ocean.</p>
    <p>I brought these three things:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A bathing suit</li>
      <li>Sunscreen</li>
      <li>A towel</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Swimming in the Ocean</h3>
    <p>
      Once I found a good spot. I put on my bathing suit and went into
      the water.
    </p>
    <p>It was cold at first, but I got used to it.</p>
    <h3>Relaxing on the Beach</h3>
    <p>
      After swimming, I laid on my towel and relaxed. I put on
      sunscreen to protect my skin from the sun.
