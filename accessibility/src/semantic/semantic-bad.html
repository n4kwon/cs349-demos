    A blog about my adventures. <br />
    <div class="blog-title">A trip to the beach</div>
    Yesterday, I went to the beach to see the ocean. <br /><br />
    I brought these three things: <br /><br />
    <div class="list">
      1. A bathing suit <br />
      2. Sunscreen <br />
      3. A towel
    </div>
    <div class="heading">Swimming in the Ocean</div>
    Once I found a good spot. I put on my bathing suit and went into
    the water. <br /><br />
    It was cold at first, but I got used to it.
    <div class="heading">Relaxing on the Beach</div>
    After swimming, I laid on my towel and relaxed. I put on sunscreen
    to protect my skin from the sun.
